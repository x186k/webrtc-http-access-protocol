                      WebRTC HTTPS Access Protocol

Abstract

   WebRTC is a set of APIs and protocols which enables real-time audio,
   video and data commnications.  WebRTC was purposely designed lacking
   end-to-end signalling protcols for creating WebRTC sessions.  WHAP
   stands for WebRTC HTTPS Access Protocol.  WHAP is intended to provide
   a simple HTTPS based signalling method for sending one-way media and
   data between two WebRTC participants.  WHAP is unique from WHIP,
   another HTTPS based WebRTC signalling protocol, in that WHAP HTTPS
   sessions are initiated by media/data receivers, not media/data
   senders.

1.  Introduction

   More information can be found in [I-D.nottingham-for-the-users].  (An
   example of an informative reference in the middle of text.  Note that
   referencing an Internet Draft involves replacing "draft-" in the name
   with "I-D.".)

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader may wish to note that one of the two RFC references in the
   preceding paragraph was normative; the other was informative.  These
   will be correctly identified as such in the References section below.

3.  Background

   This is some background text

4.  Use Cases

   This section will include some use cases for our new protocol.  The
   use cases conform to the guidelines found in [RFC7268].
   (Demonstrating a normative reference inline.)

   Note that the section heading also includes an anchor name that can
   be referenced in a cross reference later in the document, as is done
   in Section 5 of this document.  (Demonstrating using a reference to a
   heading without writing an actual anchor, but rather using the
   heading name in lowercase and with dashes.)

4.1.  First use case

   Some text about the first use case.  (And an example of using a
   second level heading.)

4.2.  Second use case

   This example includes a list:

   *  first item

   *  second item

   *  third item

   And text below the list.

4.3.  Third use case

   This use case includes some ascii art.  The format for this art is as
   follows:

           0
          +-+
          |A|
          +-+

5.  Security Considerations

   As outlined earlier in Section 4, there could be security issues in
   various use cases.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
